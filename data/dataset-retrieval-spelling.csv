What is the Cafeteria Plan?
Simply put, the Cafeteria Plan is a way for you to tailor your employee benefits to suit your individual needs and preferences. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, this plan allows you to choose from a menu of benefits that resonate with you. Whether you value extra time off, enhanced healthcare options, or other perks, this plan gives you the flexibility to create a benefits package that aligns perfectly with your life.

How and When?
Around November 25th each year, you will receive a document with a list of options to choose from and you will have approximately three weeks to complete and submit it.

Connecting to the site
Go to the following URL : https://customer.connecting-expertise.com/.
Connect with the following credentials, if it is your first time:
Login : info@dtsc.be
Mot de passe : pipeline2029@DTSC
Or with your own credentials, if you have already created and use a “Sales Manager” profile.
After that, you will be redirected to the main page, where you can then access (A) the parameters setting panel, (B) the requests/vacature propositions panel, (C) or the customers/contract panel.

Creating a “Sales Manager” profile:
To create a “Sales Manager” profile, you need to go to the “parameters setting panel”, click on “Administration” and access the “Users” tab. There click on “Create a new user” and fill the corresponding information. It is not mandatory to create a “Sales Manager” profile, everything can be done with the admin user “info@dtsc.be” (Thibault Draye), though creating your own profile allows you to get mail notifications. The notification settings can be changed through the “Notifications” tab of the “parameters setting panel”.

Selecting activities of interest:
In the “My Activities” tab of the “parameters setting panel”, you can select sectors from which you want to see the potential vacatures and from which regions. Most of the relevant sectors in Belgium for DTSC have already been selected, but feel free to add new ones.

Finding a mission:
To find a vacature, you need to go to the “requests received” tab in the ""requests panel"". There you will find all vacature propositions (accordingly to the activities settings) on which you can then apply specific filters. One interesting filter is the “Status” filter that allows you to see past requests (if you want to have an idea about what kind of jobs a specific client is proposing).
Subsequently, when you have found a vacature that interests you, you can click on the reference hyperlink to propose your candidature. There you will be redirected to the ""request details"" page, where you have more details about the mission (e.g. description, desired start date, maximal daily rate, etc.). Then to candidate yourself or anyone else, you need to click on “Create a proposal” and follow the filling steps. Though, pay attention to the “Statute” parameters in the “Create a proposal” sub-window, as we all are DTSC employee, you need to select the latter option, if you are candidating yourself or anyone of us.

Afterwards, when your proposal has been created, you need to publish it to make it effective.

Following a candidature:

We have extracted relevant information from a regulation to provide you with a clear and precise overview of these rules.

Legal Leave Days

Legal leave days must be taken during the corresponding calendar year, in accordance with Article 64 of the Royal Decree of March 30, 1967. Postponing these days to the following year is not allowed. Even substituting payment for actual leave is not permitted, except in cases of extended incapacity for work.

It is worth noting that while certain companies may tolerate the carryover of legal leave days to the following year, this practice contradicts the law. Any exception to this rule must be justified by exceptional circumstances and documented in case of a specific request by an employee.

We have extracted relevant information from a regulation to provide you with a clear and precise overview of these rules.

Legal Leave Days

Legal leave days must be took during the coresponding calendar year, in accordence with Article 64 of the Royal Decree of March 30, 1967. Postponing these days to the folowing year is not alowed. Even substituting payment for actual leave is not permited, except in cases of extended incapacity for work.

It is worth noting that while certein companies may tollerate the carryover of legal leave days to the folowing year, this practice contradicts the law. Any exception to this rule must be justified by exceptional circumstances and documented in case of a specific request by an employee.

With an amount of €50 per month per child, we provide an additional financial boost to our employees. Moreover, this benefit is tax-deductible and exempt from social security contributions.

Increasing gross salary by €50 easily costs the employer €62.50 (taking into account all taxes and contributions). At month-end, the employee retains only about €22. With the supplementary family allowances system, the employer spends only the intended €50, and the employee receives approximately €25.

Birth and Marriage Bonuses

We provide a bonus of €50 for each childbirth.
Employees receive a bonus of €245 for marriage or registered partnership.

DTheme Sharing Companions
At DTheme Sharing Companions (DTSC), we recognize the paramount importance of communication and collaboration. These core values are the foundation of our organizational structure, which is designed to foster an environment where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.

DTSC organizes itself around specific themes, each of which members can freely join based on their interests and expertise. This thematic approach ensures that every member finds a space where they can connect, collaborate, and grow alongside like-minded peers.

Each theme is led by a dedicated coordinator whose responsibilities are crucial to the success and cohesion of the group. The coordinator's duties include:
Ensuring Effective Communication and Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating open communication within the theme and organizing relevant training sessions.
Monitoring Motivation and Addressing Issues: Keeping a pulse on member motivation and addressing any concerns promptly.
Fostering Business Opportunities: Developing business opportunities and missions for theme members.
Active Recruitment and Initial Screening: Seeking out new talent and conducting initial interviews.
Cross-Theme Collaboration: Representing their theme's interests and fostering collaboration with other themes.

DTransversal Service & Coordination
At DTSC, we believe that effective communication and collaboration are the keys to success. That's why every two weeks, we hold a virtual team meeting where all coordinators of the themes are invited to discuss the latest updates and exchange ideas on a variety of topics.

The DTransversal Service & Coordination (DTSC) structure is designed to bring together the coordinators of various themes to achieve the following objectives:
Ensure Cross-Theme Communication and Collaboration: DTSC promotes seamless communication and collaboration among the different themes, ensuring that all teams are aligned and working harmoniously towards common goals.

DTSCoworking
At DTSC, we believe that working together and fostering a sense of community among our team members is essential for our success. That's why every two months, we organize a collective coworking day where our team members come together to work, connect, and collaborate.

This coworking day is structured to allow for both individual and collective work. The first half of the day is dedicated to individual work, allowing team members to focus on their client work and other individual tasks. During this time, team members are able to work for their clients remotely at the coworking location.

In the second half of the day, we come together as a team to work on internal projects and initiatives. This time is dedicated to brainstorming, collaboration, and collective problem-solving, allowing us to tackle important issues facing our organization and to ensure that we are all aligned with our common goals and objectives. During our CoWorking sessions, activities will be organized into workshops led by different themes. Each participant is free to join the workshops that interest them. This approach allows for dynamic interaction, learning, and collaboration across various areas of expertise within DTSC.

To ensure that all team members are able to participate, we rotate the location of our coworking day among different coworking spaces in the area. This not only allows us to experience a variety of workspaces and environments but also helps to make the commute accessible and convenient for everyone.

We recognize that building a sense of community and connectedness among our team members is critical for our organization's long-term success. By providing regular opportunities for our team members to come together, collaborate, and work towards shared goals, we are able to foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and excellence. In this way, we are able to deliver the best possible results for our clients, stakeholders, and team members alike.

DTeam Spirit Challenge
At DTSC, we recognize the importance of cultivating strong bonds and relationships among our team members that extend beyond the workplace. To achieve this goal, we organize an external activity every three months, which provides an opportunity for the team to come together and socialize in a more relaxed and informal setting. We call this initiative the ""DTeam Spirit Challenge.""

The primary objective of the DTeam Spirit Challenge is to foster a spirit of camaraderie and collaboration among our team members while engaging in a fun and exciting activity. Each challenge is carefully curated to appeal to a wide range of interests and personalities, with the aim of ensuring that everyone can participate and enjoy the experience.

Over the time, we have organized several activities that have become staples of our DTeam Spirit Challenge, including a Christmas dinner with all of our team members and their families, participating in the Brussels 20km race either by running or as part of our cheering squad, a gastronomic team dinner to unwind and de-stress from our busy schedules, and even a thrilling virtual reality experience that allowed us to immerse ourselves in the world of zombies.

Our DTeam Spirit Challenge events serve as a valuable opportunity for our team members to get to know each other outside of the office, build deeper connections, and develop a stronger sense of community. We believe that investing in these relationships is essential for creating a positive and productive workplace culture, which ultimately translates into better results for our clients and stakeholders.

At DTSC, we are committed to fostering a supportive, collaborative, and fun work environment where all team members feel valued and appreciated. Our DTeam Spirit Challenge is just one of the many ways in which we strive to achieve this goal, and we look forward to continuing this tradition for years to come.",What activities are included in the DTeam Spirit Challenge,no,

Over the time, we have organized several activities that have become staples of our DTeam Spirit Challenge, inclueding a Christmas dinner with all of our team members and their families, participating in the Brussels 20km race either by running or as part of our cheering squad, a gastronomic team dinner to unwind and de-stress from our busy schedules, and even a thrilling virtual reality experience that allowed us to immerse ourselves in the world of zombies.

Our DTeam Spirit Challenge events serve as a valuable opportunity for our team members to get to know each other outside of the office, build deeper connections, and develop a stronger sense of community. We believe that investing in these relationships is essential for creating a positive and productive workplace culture, which ultimately translates into better results for our clients and stakeholders.

At DTSC, we are committed to fostering a suportive, colaborative, and fun work environment where all team members feel valued and appreciated. Our DTeam Spirit Challenge is just one of the many ways in which we strive to achieve this goal, and we look forward to continuing this tradition for years to come.",,yes,

Lean (productivity) Six Sigma (variability) is a management method made to improve the quality and the efficiency of the processes.
This continuous improvement approach offers many advantages:
it improves the client's satisfaction;
it increases the global performance of the enterprise;
it responds to the strategic objectives.
Being Lean is to operate in an economical way, without wasting resources and time. Simply produce what's needed to meet the demand. It also means promote the agility of the operations and the ability to quickly deliver the customers.
Being Six Sigma means delivering products to the customers that meet their expectations. Hence, a process operating at Six Sigma quality level will generate only three defects per million occurrences. This level of quality indicates the direction to follow.
Because it is based on the experience of the people in the field, it allows us to involve and motivate the employees at all levels of the company to satisfy the customer.

Scrum
In software development, Agile is not only an iterative and incremental approach but rather a ""mindset"" to be able to face and respond to change.
Agile software development gathers all practices and frameworks based on the Agile manifesto.
Scrum is one of the most widely used Agile frameworks, it is a lightweight framework based on empiricism and Lean thinking (as explained in the Scrum guide), to address complex problems and deliver value as soon as possible to the customers.
This is done by autonomous teams working using short cycles called ""sprints"" and the introduction of roles, ceremonies, artifacts described in the Scrum guide.
Nowadays, many organizations give training about Scrum and the best way to find the training session that suits you is to go to Scrum.org or Scrum Alliance.org. There you will have access to the schedule of all the classes given by coaches all around the world. At DTSC we have no preference but we have a good experience with PYXIS. Feel free to propose a training session to your CEO for approval.
