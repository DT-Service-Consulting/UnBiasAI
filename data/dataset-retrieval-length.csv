This innovative offering is designed with one key principle in mind: putting you in the driver's seat when it comes to your compensation package. We believe that your benefits should be as unique as you are, and the Cafeteria Plan is here to make that a reality.

What is the Cafeteria Plan?
Simply put, the Cafeteria Plan is a way for you to tailor your employee benefits to suit your individual needs and preferences. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, this plan allows you to choose from a menu of benefits that resonate with you. Whether you value extra time off, enhanced healthcare options, or other perks, this plan gives you the flexibility to create a benefits package that aligns perfectly with your life.

How and When?
Around November 25th each year, you will receive a document with a list of options to choose from and you will have approximately three weeks to complete and submit it.

Why is it Great for You?
Empowerment: We believe you should have a say in your benefits, and the Cafeteria Plan puts the power of choice back into your hands. It's all about empowering you to make decisions that matter most to you.
Customization: Your needs are unique, and so should be your benefits package. With the Cafeteria Plan, you can customize your compensation in a way that suits your life circumstances.
Satisfaction: When you have a benefits package that caters to your needs, it naturally leads to higher job satisfaction. We want you to be happy, engaged, and motivated in your role.
Work-Life Balance: Achieving a healthy work-life balance is essential. The Cafeteria Plan allows you to convert part of your salary into additional time off or other benefits that promote your well-being.
Financial Benefits: You can also choose benefits that make sense for your financial goals. From tax-advantaged options to retirement contributions, this plan helps you plan for your financial future.
Retention and Attraction: Not only does this plan benefit you, but it also makes us a more attractive employer. It can enhance our ability to attract top talent and keep our existing team members engaged and loyal.

What Benefits Can You Choose From?

Proc√©dure Compl√®te de Configuration Chargemap Business pour la Recharge √† Domicile

Phase Pr√©liminaire: Installation et Validation Technique
- La premi√®re √©tape cruciale est de s'assurer que la borne de recharge soit correctement install√©e au domicile du collaborateur
- L'installateur professionnel doit configurer la borne pour qu'elle soit visible dans l'√©cosyst√®me Chargemap
- Une proc√©dure de validation technique doit √™tre effectu√©e entre l'installateur et Chargemap pour confirmer la connectivit√©
- Cette √©tape pr√©liminaire doit √™tre enti√®rement compl√©t√©e avant de proc√©der aux configurations administratives

Collecte des Informations Essentielles pour la Configuration
- Code EAN du compteur √©lectrique du domicile (identifiant unique du point de livraison d'√©lectricit√©)
- Documentation d√©taill√©e du tarif d'√©lectricit√© actuellement en vigueur pour le collaborateur
- Adresse compl√®te et pr√©cise du lieu d'installation de la borne (domicile du collaborateur)
- Sp√©cifications techniques de la borne, notamment sa puissance de charge (7,4kW, 22kW ou autre)
- Ces informations sont indispensables pour la configuration correcte dans le syst√®me Chargemap Business

Proc√©dure de Configuration dans le Syst√®me Chargemap Business
- Utiliser le code EAN du compteur comme r√©f√©rence pour le num√©ro de PDL (Point De Livraison) dans le syst√®me
- Pour la d√©signation, adopter une nomenclature claire indiquant la propri√©t√© de la borne, par exemple: ""Borne Smappee Sylvain"" 
- Au point 3 de la proc√©dure: effectuer une v√©rification essentielle des licences disponibles
- S'assurer imp√©rativement qu'il existe autant de licences standard disponibles que de bornes domestiques √† configurer
- Chaque borne domestique n√©cessite une licence standard d√©di√©e dans le syst√®me Chargemap Business

Remarques Importantes pour la Gestion Future
- Une fois configur√©e, la borne sera visible dans le tableau de bord administrateur de Chargemap Business
- Le suivi de consommation permettra un remboursement pr√©cis des frais d'√©lectricit√© du collaborateur
- Les modifications ult√©rieures de tarification √©lectrique devront √™tre signal√©es pour mise √† jour dans le syst√®me",,,

Or with your own credentials, if you have already created and use a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile.
After that, you will be redirected to the main page, where you can then access (A) the parameters setting panel, (B) the requests/vacature propositions panel, (C) or the customers/contract panel.

Creating a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile:
To create a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile, you need to go to the ‚Äúparameters setting panel‚Äù, click on ‚ÄúAdministration‚Äù and access the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù tab. There click on ‚ÄúCreate a new user‚Äù and fill the corresponding information. It is not mandatory to create a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile, everything can be done with the admin user ‚Äúinfo@dtsc.be‚Äù (Thibault Draye), though creating your own profile allows you to get mail notifications. The notifications setting can be changed through the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù tab of the ‚Äúparameters setting panel‚Äù.

Selecting activities of interest:
In the ‚ÄúMy Activities‚Äù tab of the ‚Äúparameters setting panel‚Äù, you can select sectors from which you want to see the potential vacatures and from which regions. Most of the relevant sectors in Belgium for DTSC have already been selected, but feel free to add new ones.

Finding a mission:
To find a vacature, you need to go to ‚Äúrequests received‚Äù tab in the ""requests panel"". There you will find all vacature propositions (accordingly to the activities settings) on which you can then apply specific filters. One interesting filter is the ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù filter that allows you to see past requests (if you want to have an idea about what kind of jobs a specific client is proposing).
Subsequently, when you have found a vacature that interests you, you can click on the reference hyperlink to propose your candidature. There you will be redirected to the ""request details"" page, where you have more details about the mission (e.g. description, desired start date, maximal daily rate, etc.). Then to candidate yourself or anyone else, you need to click on ‚ÄúCreate a proposal‚Äù and follow the filling steps. Though, pay attention to the ‚ÄúStatute‚Äù parameters in the ‚ÄúCreate a proposal‚Äù sub-window, as we all are DTSC employee, you need to select the latter option, if you are candidating yourself or anyone of us.

Afterwards, when your proposal has been created, you need to publish it to make it effective.

Following a candidature:
When the proposal is published, it is then sent to the client and you can find it back in the ‚ÄúOngoing proposals‚Äù tab of the ‚Äúrequests panel‚Äù.",How do I log in to Connecting Expertise?,2383,long

Cr√©er le contenu de la page

(1) La premi√®re chose √† faire est de choisir l'endroit ou cette page se situera, si dans la liste d√©roulante vous s√©lectionnez par exemple services, la page que vous publiez se trouvera :

(2) Ensuite, il faut rajouter un titre de page, il faut qu'il soit √† la fois petit, mais suffisamment clair et pertinent.

(3) Dans le bloc l√† il faut rajouter le corps du texte, nous utiliserons toujours la m√™me structure bas√©e sur le prompt suivant :

Contexte de la page : [Indiquez ici le sujet principal de la page, par exemple : pr√©sentation d'un service, description d'un produit, information sur l'entreprise, etc.]

Objectifs de la page : [D√©crivez les objectifs : informer, convertir, engager, am√©liorer le r√©f√©rencement, etc.]

Instructions sp√©cifiques : Liens internes : Inclure au moins deux liens vers des pages connexes sur le site. Mentionnez quelles pages si n√©cessaire ou laissez-moi les sugg√©rer.

Liens externes : Ajouter au moins un lien vers une source fiable ou un site de r√©f√©rence pertinent pour le sujet. 

Image : D√©crire une image pertinente √† int√©grer (ou donner une description pour la cr√©er). 

Call to Action (CTA) : Inclure un appel √† l'action clair et engageant (formulaire, inscription, t√©l√©chargement, etc.) .

Mots-cl√©s : Int√©grer au moins 10 mots-cl√©s strat√©giques et pertinents pour le sujet. 

Hi√©rarchie de balises : Utiliser une structure bien organis√©e avec des balises H1, H2, H3, etc., pour une lecture fluide et optimis√©e pour le SEO. 

Longueur : R√©diger un contenu entre 300 et 800 mots, selon la complexit√© du sujet.

Utilise le code html ci dessous en exemple 

Cela nous assure que la page a √©t√© pens√©e avec un objectif, un contexte, une analyse high level de mots, des liens internes, des liens externes, une image, un bouton appelant √† l'action du lecteur.

(4) Ajouter un m√©dia permet d'ajouter une image, il a √©t√© prouv√© qu'une page sans image provoque une augmentation du taux de rebond (l'envie des utilisateurs de partir du site)

(5) En appuyant sur le (+) √† c√¥t√© d'un des drapeaux, nous cr√©ons un double de cette page qui sera alors √† traduire (par gpt). Attention, si vous le pr√©cisez GPT reconnait assez bien les URL pour les corriger en fonction de la langue, mais des erreurs sont fr√©quentes.

(6) Enregistrer le brouillon, afin de garder un contr√¥le sur le contenu de notre site, nous ne laisserons pas √† tous la possibilit√© de publier des modifications sur le site de production directement.

We have extracted relevant information from a regulation to provide you with a clear and precise overview of these rules.

Legal Leave Days

Legal leave days must be taken during the corresponding calendar year, in accordance with Article 64 of the Royal Decree of March 30, 1967. Postponing these days to the following year is not allowed. Even substituting payment for actual leave is not permitted, except in cases of extended incapacity for work.

It is worth noting that while certain companies may tolerate the carryover of legal leave days to the following year, this practice contradicts the law. Any exception to this rule must be justified by exceptional circumstances and documented in case of a specific request by an employee.

RTT / Compensatory Rest Days

It is imperative to take the reduction of working time (RTT) / compensatory rest days before the end of the year to avoid exceeding the average working duration (38 hours per week).

In conclusion, at DTSC, we adhere to the rules and laws regarding the deferral of leave days currently in force. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these provisions to ensure optimal management of your leaves and to maintain a healthy balance between your professional and personal life.",What are compensatory rest days?,1091,medium

It is worth noting that while certain companies may tolerate the carryover of legal leave days to the following year, this practice contradicts the law. Any exception to this rule must be justified by exceptional circumstances and documented in case of a specific request by an employee.

Understanding the Legal Framework:
- The Royal Decree of March 30, 1967 establishes that annual leave must be taken within the calendar year
- Belgian labor law places importance on ensuring employees take proper rest periods
- Labor inspection can penalize companies that systematically allow leave carryover
- The Social Security Office may also question practices that deviate from the legal framework

Common Misconceptions:
- Many employees assume leave days automatically transfer to the next year
- Some believe unused leave can be exchanged for financial compensation
- There is confusion between legal leave days and other types of time off

RTT / Compensatory Rest Days

It is imperative to take the reduction of working time (RTT) / compensatory rest days before the end of the year to avoid exceeding the average working duration (38 hours per week).

Planning Your Leave:
- We recommend planning your leave well in advance throughout the year
- Your manager will help ensure team coverage while facilitating leave requests
- The HR department can assist with any questions regarding leave entitlements
- Our internal tracking system allows you to monitor your remaining leave balance

In conclusion, at DTSC, we adhere to the rules and laws regarding the deferral of leave days currently in force. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these provisions to ensure optimal management of your leaves and to maintain a healthy balance between your professional and personal life.

This page covers how to export and import leads from Odoo CRM. Detailed explanations can be found in the CRMtools_Documentation_2025.odt document.

1. Connecting to the Odoo CRM.

For the installation of the project, follow the instructions found on GitHub. Once the installation is complete, the next step is to fill out the .env file with the following configurations and the corresponding Odoo credentials (username & password).

Configuration details:
- SERVER_URL: Your Odoo server address
- DATABASE_NAME: Name of your Odoo database
- USERNAME: Your Odoo username
- PASSWORD: Your Odoo password
- API_KEY: If applicable for your installation

The user can check if the configurations are properly set with the code shown below.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from odoo_connector import export_leads, import_leads

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get credentials
server = os.getenv(""SERVER_URL"")
db = os.getenv(""DATABASE_NAME"")
username = os.getenv(""USERNAME"")
password = os.getenv(""PASSWORD"")

# Print to verify
print(f""Connecting to {server}, database: {db}"")
print(f""Username: {username}"")
```

This script verifies the connection by printing the credentials and imports the necessary functions for exporting and importing the CRM leads.

2. Exporting leads to a CSV file.

There are a few steps to follow to retrieve and save the leads from Odoo.

Step 1: Choose the information (fields) to extract from Odoo CRM.
Common fields include:
- name: Lead/Opportunity name
- partner_id: Related partner
- email_from: Email address
- phone: Phone number
- date_deadline: Expected closing date
- user_id: Salesperson
- team_id: Sales team
- tag_ids: Tags
- stage_id: Stage

Step 2: Choose the page (CRM in our case).
- Contacts page: 'res.partner'
- CRM page: 'crm.lead'

Step 3: Choose a name for the file.
Example: 'opportunities.csv'

```python
# Export leads example
fields = ['id', 'name', 'partner_id', 'email_from', 'phone', 
          'date_deadline', 'user_id', 'team_id', 'tag_ids', 'stage_id']
export_leads(fields, 'crm.lead', 'opportunities.csv')
```

The following image shows the structure of the code and the output with the CRM leads.
[Note: Image would be displayed here in the original document]

3. Importing leads from a CSV file.

To import data, the user only needs to write the path location of the corresponding CSV file with the leads to import. The fields (columns) are already set up within the function; however, additional fields can be added.

```python
# Import leads example
import_leads('path/to/your/opportunities.csv')
```

CSV file requirements:
- Must include header row with field names
- Field names must match Odoo field names
- Required fields must be included (name at minimum)
- Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Relations (like partner_id) should use the database ID

A complete list of the fields available can be accessed through the ""fields_available"" variable.

```python
# Print available fields
print(fields_available)
```

Common issues and troubleshooting:
- Authentication errors: Check credentials in .env file
- Field not found: Verify field names match exactly with Odoo
- Import errors: Check CSV format and required fields
- Permissions: Ensure user has rights to create/modify leads",,,

# Company Vehicle Insurance Acquisition Process

## Initial Request and Contact Procedure

The insurance acquisition process begins with the CEO reaching out directly to our insurance provider, Van Dessel Insurance. This communication must include:

- A formal request for an insurance offer
- Complete technical specifications of the vehicle requiring coverage
- Vehicle identification information (VIN, make, model, year)
- Intended primary driver information
- Desired coverage options (if specific requirements exist)

The request should be directed to one of our dedicated insurance contacts:

**Primary Contact:**

**Alternative Contact:**
* Christella Orlando
* Direct telephone line: +32 (0)2 669 22 23
* Email address: CHRISTELLA.ORLANDO@vandessel.be

## Offer Review and Decision Process

Following the submission of vehicle details, the insurance company will prepare a comprehensive offer that typically includes:

- Premium amount and payment schedule
- Coverage details and policy limitations
- Deductible amounts for various claim scenarios
- Additional services included (roadside assistance, courtesy vehicle, etc.)
- Terms and conditions of the policy

The CEO will thoroughly review this offer to ensure it meets the company's requirements for:
- Adequate coverage levels for company liability protection
- Competitive pricing aligned with budget expectations
- Appropriate additional services and support
- Compliance with legal requirements for vehicle operation

## Finalization and Documentation

If the terms of the insurance offer are deemed satisfactory:

- The CEO will sign the offer document, indicating formal acceptance
- The signed document will be returned to Van Dessel Insurance via email
- The insurance company will process the acceptance and activate the policy
- Upon activation, the insurance company will issue confirmation of coverage
- A temporary green card (international insurance certificate) will be provided immediately
- This temporary documentation allows for legal vehicle operation while awaiting permanent documentation
- The permanent green card and full policy documentation will follow via mail or courier

## Important Notes

- The temporary green card is legally valid and must be kept in the vehicle at all times
- Coverage becomes effective from the moment the insurance company confirms receipt of the signed offer
- Any specific requirements or modifications to standard coverage must be explicitly requested during the initial contact
- Questions regarding coverage details should be directed to the designated insurance contacts listed above",,,

To support our team members during these pivotal events, we provide various benefits in accordance with legislation. Here's what we do:

Supplementary Family Allowances
As an employer, we grant supplementary family allowances to employees already receiving legal family allowances. However, we no longer offer these supplementary allowances as part of the cafeteria plan options.

With an amount of ‚Ç¨50 per month per child, we provide an additional financial boost to our employees. Moreover, this benefit is tax-deductible and exempt from social security contributions.

Example calculation for your supplementary family allowances:
Increasing gross salary by ‚Ç¨50 easily costs the employer ‚Ç¨62.50 (taking into account all taxes and contributions). At month-end, the employee retains only about ‚Ç¨22. With the supplementary family allowances system, the employer spends only the intended ‚Ç¨50, and the employee receives approximately ‚Ç¨25.

Birth and Marriage Bonuses
Bonuses given for the birth or marriage of employees are thoughtful gestures. They demonstrate our sensitivity to the value of significant life milestones, gestures our employees will remember.

We provide a bonus of ‚Ç¨50 for each childbirth.
Employees receive a bonus of ‚Ç¨245 for marriage or registered partnership.
The bonus for registered partnership applies to legal cohabitation within the recognized legal framework.
These bonuses are exempt from social security contributions. They serve as gestures of support and recognition for our employees during these significant life events.

At DTSC, we believe in actively supporting our employees not just in their professional endeavors but also in their personal lives.

1-on-1
These quarterly meetings (every three months) with the CEO are an integral part of our company's commitment to employee development and engagement. By providing each individual with dedicated one-on-one time with our CEO, we ensure that everyone has a chance to voice their concerns, ask questions, and offer feedback on their experiences within the organization.

During these meetings, employees are encouraged to share their career aspirations and goals, and the CEO provides guidance and support on how to achieve them. This personalized attention not only helps individuals grow and succeed in their roles, but it also contributes to the overall success of the company by building a team of highly motivated and engaged employees.

In addition to discussing personal goals and aspirations, these meetings are also an opportunity to discuss the company's long-term strategy and vision. By keeping employees informed and engaged in the company's plans for growth and development, we ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and contributing to the overall success of the organization.

Overall, these individual meetings with the CEO serve as a critical touchpoint for our employees, helping to foster a culture of openness, transparency, and accountability. By regularly engaging with our team members in this way, we are able to build stronger relationships and create a more cohesive and effective team.

DTheme Sharing Companions
At DTheme Sharing Companions (DTSC), we recognize the paramount importance of communication and collaboration. These core values are the foundation of our organizational structure, which is designed to foster an environment where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.

DTSC organizes itself around specific themes, each of which members can freely join based on their interests and expertise. This thematic approach ensures that every member finds a space where they can connect, collaborate, and grow alongside like-minded peers.

Each theme is led by a dedicated coordinator whose responsibilities are crucial to the success and cohesion of the group. The coordinator's duties include:
Ensuring Effective Communication and Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating open communication within the theme and organizing relevant training sessions.
Monitoring Motivation and Addressing Issues: Keeping a pulse on member motivation and addressing any concerns promptly.
Fostering Business Opportunities: Developing business opportunities and missions for theme members.
Active Recruitment and Initial Screening: Seeking out new talent and conducting initial interviews.
Cross-Theme Collaboration: Representing their theme's interests and fostering collaboration with other themes.

DTransversal Service & Coordination
At DTSC, we believe that effective communication and collaboration are the keys to success. That's why every two weeks, we hold a virtual team meeting where all coordinators of the themes are invited to discuss the latest updates and exchange ideas on a variety of topics.

The DTransversal Service & Coordination (DTSC) structure is designed to bring together the coordinators of various themes to achieve the following objectives:
Ensure Cross-Theme Communication and Collaboration: DTSC promotes seamless communication and collaboration among the different themes, ensuring that all teams are aligned and working harmoniously towards common goals.
Share Best Practices: Coordinators share successful strategies and best practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning across all themes.
Review Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Regular review of KPIs ensures that the progress and performance of each theme are monitored, and necessary adjustments are made to achieve optimal outcomes.
Organize CoWorking & TeamBuilding Events: DTSC coordinates upcoming CoWorking and TeamBuilding events to enhance team cohesion, foster a positive work environment, and strengthen relationships among members.

Through these efforts, the DTransversal Service & Coordination structure ensures that DTSC operates as a unified and efficient organization, maximizing the potential of every member and theme.

DTSCoworking
At DTSC, we believe that working together and fostering a sense of community among our team members is essential for our success. That's why every two months, we organize a collective coworking day where our team members come together to work, connect, and collaborate.

This coworking day is structured to allow for both individual and collective work. The first half of the day is dedicated to individual work, allowing team members to focus on their client work and other individual tasks. During this time, team members are able to work for their clients remotely at the coworking location.

In the second half of the day, we come together as a team to work on internal projects and initiatives. This time is dedicated to brainstorming, collaboration, and collective problem-solving, allowing us to tackle important issues facing our organization and to ensure that we are all aligned with our common goals and objectives. During our CoWorking sessions, activities will be organized into workshops led by different themes. Each participant is free to join the workshops that interest them. This approach allows for dynamic interaction, learning, and collaboration across various areas of expertise within DTSC.

To ensure that all team members are able to participate, we rotate the location of our coworking day among different coworking spaces in the area. This not only allows us to experience a variety of workspaces and environments but also helps to make the commute accessible and convenient for everyone.

We recognize that building a sense of community and connectedness among our team members is critical for our organization's long-term success. By providing regular opportunities for our team members to come together, collaborate, and work towards shared goals, we are able to foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and excellence. In this way, we are able to deliver the best possible results for our clients, stakeholders, and team members alike.

DTeam Spirit Challenge
At DTSC, we recognize the importance of cultivating strong bonds and relationships among our team members that extend beyond the workplace. To achieve this goal, we organize an external activity every three months, which provides an opportunity for the team to come together and socialize in a more relaxed and informal setting. We call this initiative the ""DTeam Spirit Challenge.""

The primary objective of the DTeam Spirit Challenge is to foster a spirit of camaraderie and collaboration among our team members while engaging in a fun and exciting activity. Each challenge is carefully curated to appeal to a wide range of interests and personalities, with the aim of ensuring that everyone can participate and enjoy the experience.

Over the time, we have organized several activities that have become staples of our DTeam Spirit Challenge, including a Christmas dinner with all of our team members and their families, participating in the Brussels 20km race either by running or as part of our cheering squad, a gastronomic team dinner to unwind and de-stress from our busy schedules, and even a thrilling virtual reality experience that allowed us to immerse ourselves in the world of zombies.

Our DTeam Spirit Challenge events serve as a valuable opportunity for our team members to get to know each other outside of the office, build deeper connections, and develop a stronger sense of community. We believe that investing in these relationships is essential for creating a positive and productive workplace culture, which ultimately translates into better results for our clients and stakeholders.

At DTSC, we are committed to fostering a supportive, collaborative, and fun work environment where all team members feel valued and appreciated. Our DTeam Spirit Challenge is just one of the many ways in which we strive to achieve this goal, and we look forward to continuing this tradition for years to come.",What activities are included in the DTeam Spirit Challenge,6999,long

This applies to any employee faced with the choice between a new company car and other mobility alternatives, rather than someone whose vehicle leasing is already in progress.

First Tier: Environmentally Friendly Company Car

In the first tier of the Mobility Budget program, you have the option to select electric Vehicle - following internal mobility policy.

Second Tier: Sustainable Transportation Methods

The second tier of the Mobility Budget covers a wide range of sustainable transportation options, including:

Active Mobility: This includes bicycles, electric bicycles, scooters, and other similar options, ideal for short commutes within 45 kilometers per hour.
Public Transportation: You can use your budget for subscriptions and tickets for public transport within Belgium and the European Economic Area.
Carpooling and Ridesharing: Participate in carpooling or ridesharing initiatives to share rides with colleagues or others.

For instance, you can opt for a more economical electric car, if it falls below the TCO limit specified for your employee category and additionally, housing-related expenses can be accommodated within the allocated budget.

Calculation of Your Mobility Budget (Total Cost of Ownership or TCO)

Your mobility budget corresponds to the annual total gross cost of the company car for the employer. This includes all related expenses, such as:

All tax-related charges.
Financing costs (leasing or rental).
Electricity costs.
Solidarity contributions.
Any applicable insurance expenses.
All expenditures associated with the company car, including non-deductible VAT, and more.

It's important to note that your mobility budget should never be less than ‚Ç¨3,000 or exceed ‚Ç¨16,000 per year, even if the annual gross costs of the car fall below ‚Ç¨3,000 or go beyond ‚Ç¨16,000. Additionally, your mobility budget cannot exceed 1/5th of your total gross remuneration, with a minimum of ‚Ç¨3,000.

If you have any questions or require assistance in calculating your mobility budget or understanding your options, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you in making the most of your mobility benefits.

# Comprehensive Guide to Modifying User Reimbursement Rates in Nexxtmove

## Overview
This document provides detailed instructions for administrators to modify the reimbursement settings for users in the Nexxtmove platform. Following this procedure ensures that charging stations are properly linked to the correct tariff rates, allowing for accurate reimbursement of home charging costs.

## Prerequisites
* Administrative access to the Nexxtmove platform
* Knowledge of the specific reimbursement amount to be applied
* Information about which user and charging point require modification
* Understanding of the company's reimbursement policy for home charging

## Detailed Procedure

### Step 1: Access the Nexxtmove Platform
* Open your web browser and navigate to the Nexxtmove login page
* Enter your administrative credentials to access the system
* Verify you have successfully logged in with administrator privileges
* Navigate to the administrative dashboard to begin the configuration process
* Note: It is essential to first create the appropriate Tariff in User settings before attempting to link any charging points to this tariff

### Step 2: Configure User Tariff Settings
* From the main dashboard, locate and click on the ""Users"" section
* Navigate to the ""Settings"" submenu within the Users section
* Select the ""Tariffs"" option from the available settings categories
* Locate the specific tariff labeled ""Charging @ Home"" in the tariff list
* Click the ""Edit"" or pencil icon associated with this tariff to modify its properties
* Update the reimbursement amount field with the correct value (per kWh)
* Ensure the currency and calculation method are correctly configured
* Save your changes to update the tariff information in the system
* Verify the new tariff amount appears correctly in the tariff list

### Step 3: Link Charging Point to Modified Tariff
* Return to the main dashboard and locate the ""Charging Points"" section
* Navigate to the ""Settings"" submenu for charging points
* Select the specific charging point that needs to be associated with the updated tariff
* Click on the ""Tariffs"" option within the charging point's settings menu
* Look for the option to ""Subscribe to existing tariff"" or similar functionality
* Select the previously modified ""Charge @ Home"" tariff from the available options
* Confirm your selection to establish the link between the charging point and the tariff
* Save all changes to finalize the association

### Step 4: Verification and Testing
* Confirm that the charging point now displays the correct subscription to the updated tariff
* Verify that the price shown for the charging point's current subscription matches the tariff amount configured in Step 2
* If possible, run a test simulation of reimbursement to ensure calculations are correct
* Check the user dashboard to confirm the updated tariff is visible to the relevant user

## Troubleshooting
* If changes do not appear immediately, try refreshing the page or logging out and back in
* Ensure there are no conflicting tariff assignments for the same charging point
* Check system logs for any error messages if the association fails
* Contact Nexxtmove support if persistent issues occur with tariff assignments

## Notes
* Tariff changes may take up to 24 hours to fully propagate through the system
* Historical charging sessions will not be affected by tariff changes
* Only charging sessions after the tariff modification will use the new reimbursement rate
* Documentation of all tariff changes should be maintained for accounting purposes",,,

It is your responsibility to ensure that this process is followed in good time, and that your respective timesheets are sent to the DTSC billing manager before the end of the current month for monthly invoicing of your services. Internally at DTSC, and in order to ensure correct payment of your wages, it is important to add to Officient any activity that is not linked to an hour worked at a customer site (i.e. any non-billable hours): training taken as part of your professional activity; vacations, vacations or compensation time; absences, illness, etc. (proof may be required, depending on the regulations in force); other activities related to DTSC but not billable (coworking, external events, etc.).

# Comprehensive Guide to Activating Two-Factor Authentication on Odoo

## Introduction
Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an additional layer of security for your Odoo account by requiring both your password and a time-sensitive code. This guide will walk you through the complete setup process to protect your DTSC Odoo account.

## Prerequisites
* A smartphone with Microsoft Authenticator app installed
* Your Odoo account credentials
* Stable internet connection on both your computer and smartphone

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Initial Access to Odoo Platform
* Open your preferred web browser on your computer or device
* Navigate to dtsc.odoo.com in the address bar
* Enter your personal Odoo username and password
* Click ""Log in"" to access your account dashboard
* Ensure you're using your personal account, not a shared account

### 2. Accessing Security Settings
* Look for your profile picture or initials in the top right corner of the Odoo interface
* Click on this profile indicator to reveal the dropdown menu
* Select the ""Account"" option from the dropdown list
* In the account settings page, locate and click on ""Login & Security"" section
* This will take you to the page where security settings can be modified

### 3. Initiating Two-Factor Authentication Setup
* Within the Login & Security page, find the section related to two-factor authentication
* Look for the button labeled ""Enable two-factor authentication""
* Click this button to begin the setup process
* The system will display information about 2FA and its benefits
* Review this information to understand how 2FA will affect your login process

### 4. Identity Verification
* For security purposes, Odoo will request password verification before proceeding
* Enter your current Odoo password in the field provided
* This step confirms your identity and authorizes the security change
* Click ""Submit"" or ""Verify"" to proceed to the next step

### 5. Connecting with Microsoft Authenticator
* Odoo will display a QR code on your screen
* Take your smartphone and unlock it
* Open the Microsoft Authenticator application
* In the Authenticator app, look for the QR code icon typically located at the bottom right corner
* Tap this icon to activate your phone's camera
* Position your phone to scan the QR code displayed on your computer screen
* Hold steady until the app recognizes and processes the code
* Microsoft Authenticator will automatically add your Odoo account to its list

### 6. Completing the Authentication Setup
* Once scanned, Microsoft Authenticator will immediately generate a 6-digit verification code
* This code refreshes every 30 seconds for security
* Enter the current 6-digit code into the verification field on the Odoo screen
* Submit the code before it expires
* If entered correctly, Odoo will display a confirmation message
* Click ""Confirm"" or ""Complete"" to finalize the 2FA activation

## Verification and Future Use
* Odoo will confirm that two-factor authentication has been successfully enabled
* From now on, each login attempt will require both your password and a verification code
* The Microsoft Authenticator app will generate a new code each time you need to log in
* Your account now has significantly improved security against unauthorized access

## Troubleshooting Tips
* If the QR code scan fails, try adjusting lighting or distance
* Ensure your phone's time is set to automatic to prevent code synchronization issues
* If you encounter problems, contact IT support at support@dtsc.be

Executive summary

Opportunit√© : beaucoup de subsides existent en Belgique

Objectif :  avoir une connaissance minimum des subsides existants afin de faire appel aux subsides lorsque cela est possible pour un projet DTSC ou personnel (via DTSC).

Proc√©dure : Si vous pensez qu‚Äôun projet pourrait √™tre √©ligible, contactez Thibault.

A v√©rifier si toujours d'actualit√© lorsqu'on veut demander un subside :
Bernard Tilkens b.tilkens@next-steps.be (+ Florence Rubens en copie: f.rubens@next-steps.be)
Next Steps 

C‚Äôest un expert en financement et en subsides, il fait une veille permanente des diff√©rents subsides existants pour les PME en Belgique. Il travaille entre autres pour DTSC afin de voir pour quels subsides DTSC pourrait √™tre √©ligible.

What‚Äôs in for me ? Une partie du subside redistribu√© vers le consultant + r√©pond au besoin du consultant

Timing : plus nous avan√ßons rapidement, mieux c'est, car les d√©lais sont relativement longs. √Ä noter que les d√©penses ne peuvent √™tre rembours√©es par le subside qu'apr√®s r√©ception de l'accus√© de r√©ception (validation) du subside.

Obtenir des subsides peut √™tre un levier puissant pour le d√©veloppement des entreprises, mais les d√©marches et les crit√®res varient consid√©rablement selon les niveaux de gouvernance. En Belgique, les entreprises peuvent solliciter des subsides aupr√®s de diff√©rentes instances.

Chacune de ces entit√©s propose des aides sp√©cifiques, adapt√©es √† divers besoins et projets :

L‚ÄôUnion Europ√©enne : gr√¢le par rapport aux montants mais processus beaucoup plus complexes et contraignants (autant pour l‚Äôobtention que pour le suivi du subside). Subsides difficiles √† obtenir. (exemple : Fonds de transition √©nerg√©tique | SPF Economie)

F√©d√©ral : en charge des subsides en rapport avec les charges sociales, imp√¥ts, fiscalit√©, pr√©compte prof. & imp√¥t des soci√©t√©s.
R&D aussi bien en interne que pour compte de tiers
TAx Shelter (investissement entrant, croissance)
R√©duction de cotisations sociales (r√©duction pour les 6 premiers salari√©s)

R√©gions : Subsides √† vocation d√©veloppement √©conomique des entreprises :
Flandres : 30 √† 50 subsides
Bxl : 140
R√©gion Wallonne : 400 subsides

Une entreprise a un si√®ge social dans une r√©gion mais peut avoir plusieurs si√®ges d‚Äôexploitation et donc avoir acc√®s aux subsides de diff√©rentes r√©gions.
Attention : On ne va pas subsidier par les deux r√©gions la m√™me d√©pense, c‚Äôest ill√©gal (p√©nal) mais faire appel √† une r√©gion pour un projet n‚Äôexclut pas de faire appel √† une autre r√©gion.

5 familles de th√©matiques subsides r√©gionaux

Recherche & D√©veloppement
Un projet qui pr√©sente :

Des incertitudes √† caract√®re technologique, mais suffisamment convaincantes de par leur int√©r√™t industriel/commercial
Des incertitudes sur le planning (potentiellement plus long ou plus co√ªteux que pr√©vu), avec une dur√©e estim√©e d'environ deux ans.

Les subsides peuvent couvrir diff√©rents types de co√ªts :
Ressources humaines,
√âtudes de march√© (segments cibl√©s, pays vis√©s),
D√©p√¥t de brevet,
Prototypes,
Certifications CE.

Exemples d‚Äôapplication pour DTSC:

J‚Äôai une id√©e de nouveau projet √† d√©velopper, une plateforme innovante destin√©e √† am√©liorer la gestion des projets complexes. Ce projet pr√©sente des incertitudes technologiques importantes, notamment en ce qui concerne l'int√©gration de nouvelles fonctionnalit√©s bas√©es sur l'intelligence artificielle et l'analyse pr√©dictive. De plus, le planning du projet est incertain, avec une dur√©e estim√©e d'environ deux ans, mais potentiellement plus longue ou plus co√ªteuse que pr√©vu.

Je pourrais faire appel aux subsides pour engager un d√©veloppeur, r√©aliser des √©tudes de march√©, des prototypes, etc. Je fais appel √† Bernard.

Je travaille sur une mission/projet de recherche et d√©veloppement au sein d‚Äôune entreprise. Je pourrais faire subventionner mes heures de travail par DTSC, ou l‚Äôentreprise (utilisateur final ou ‚Äòimpl√©menteur‚Äô) pour l‚Äôensemble de l‚Äô√©quipe du projet d‚Äôimpl√©mentation. Tr√®s concr√®tement : Impl√©mentation d‚Äôun nouveau protocole de communication pour des armoires de protection avec 2 fournisseurs externes (General Electric et Siemens) et impl√©menter par un client (Elia) et avec un consultant chef de Projets DTSC : Elia peut faire appel √† des subsides pour financer l‚Äôensemble du projet d‚Äôimpl√©mentation. General Electric et Siemens peuvent √©galement faire subsidier leur charge de travail sur le projet. DTSC peut faire appel √† des subsides pour financer les heures du consultant chef de projet.

Engagements

Subsides √† l‚Äôembauche, pour des profils non technologiques
Entreprise de moins de 50ETP : demandeur d‚Äôemploi la veille de l‚Äôembauche ‚Äì subside qui peut durer jusque 3 ans, montant d√©gressif d‚Äôann√©e en ann√©e (36K‚Ç¨ premi√®re ann√©e) - Jusque 5 personnes en parall√®le- Montant forfaitaire √† l‚Äôentreprise pay√© trimestriellement. Si la personne part ‚Äì obligation de r√©engager dans les 6 mois

Recrutement de jeunes dipl√¥m√©s : Subsidier l'embauche de jeunes dipl√¥m√©s pour leur offrir une premi√®re exp√©rience professionnelle.
Formation continue des employ√©s : Financer des programmes de formation pour am√©liorer les comp√©tences des employ√©s actuels
Stages et apprentissages : Couvrir les co√ªts li√©s √† l'accueil de stagiaires ou d'apprentis dans l'entreprise.
Int√©gration de travailleurs handicap√©s : Subsidier l'embauche et l'adaptation des postes de travail pour les personnes en situation de handicap.

Dans le cadre de mon projet Black Belt, je souhaite solliciter un subside pour l'engagement d'une personne. Ce projet, qui vise √† optimiser nos processus internes et √† am√©liorer notre efficacit√© op√©rationnelle, n√©cessite une assistance administrative pour assurer son bon d√©roulement. L'engagement d'un assistant administratif permettra de lib√©rer du temps pour me concentrer sur les aspects strat√©giques et analytiques du projet. Je fais appel √† Bernard pour savoir si ce projet est √©ligible √† un subside.

Consultance

Pour entreprise de moins de 250 ETP : plut√¥t li√© √† la croissance, √©tudes de march√©, aspects RH
Ch√®que entreprise : possibilit√© de r√©cup√©rer 70% des co√ªts si l‚Äôentreprise est labellis√©e ch√®que entreprise (pour la Wallonie) (pour Bruxelles il existe le m√™me type de subside ; au moins 3 ans d‚Äôexp√©rience √† son CV , crit√®res officiels et officieux)
Ch√®ques langues : prendre des cours de Ndls (Subsidi√© √† 60%), ‚Ä¶
Ch√®ques formations : subsidier formation dans les 6 premiers mois de l‚Äôengagement

Dans le cadre de mon projet Black Belt, je sollicite un expert certifi√© ¬´ Cheque Entreprise ¬ª pour des comp√©tences sp√©cifiques.

Exportation

D√©placement physique : Participer √† des foires internationales, faire une √©tude de march√© internationale, ouvrir une succursale √† l‚Äô√©tranger, participer √† une mission commerciale, d√©velopper des partenariats internationaux, faire de la prospection, ‚Ä¶‚ÄØ (via l‚ÄôAWEX ou Bruxelles export)

Marketing orient√© √©tranger (doit √™tre minimum en Anglais)  
Je contacte Bernard pour savoir si ce projet pourrait √™tre √©ligible √† un subside, afin de couvrir mes frais de voyage, les entr√©es aux foires commerciales et mon h√©bergement √† New York.

Scrum
In software development, Agile is not only an iterative and incremental approach but rather a ""mindset"" to be able to face and respond to change.
Agile software development gathers all practices and frameworks based on the Agile manifesto.
Scrum is one of the most widely used Agile frameworks, it is a lightweight framework based on empiricism and Lean thinking (as explained in the Scrum guide), to address complex problems and deliver value as soon as possible to the customers.
This is done by autonomous teams working using short cycles called ""sprints"" and the introduction of roles, ceremonies, artifacts described in the Scrum guide.
Nowadays, many organizations give training about Scrum and the best way to find the training session that suits you is to go to Scrum.org or Scrum Alliance.org. There you will have access to the schedule of all the classes given by coaches all around the world. At DTSC we have no preference but we have a good experience with PYXIS. Feel free to propose a training session to your CEO for approval.

# DTSC Warrant Program: Comprehensive Guide to Alternative Remuneration

## Introduction to Warrants
DTSC offers eligible employees the opportunity to receive a portion of their variable remuneration in the form of warrants. This alternative compensation method can provide potential tax advantages while allowing employees to benefit from market performance.

## What Are Warrants?
Warrants are financial instruments that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a specified price before a predetermined expiration date. At DTSC, we specifically use the BNP PARIBAS EASY EURO STOXX 50 UCITS ETF Warrant Call, which is linked to the performance of the Euro Stoxx 50 index - a stock index representing 50 of the largest and most liquid blue-chip companies in the Eurozone.

## Benefits of the Warrant Program
* **Potential Tax Advantages**: Warrants may offer favorable tax treatment compared to traditional salary or bonus payments, potentially resulting in higher net compensation
* **Market Participation**: Opportunity to benefit from positive market movements in the Euro Stoxx 50 index
* **Diversification**: Adds a different component to your overall compensation package
* **Flexibility**: Employees can choose what percentage of their variable compensation to receive as warrants
* **Investment Exposure**: Provides exposure to equity markets without direct stock purchases

## How the Program Works
1. **Eligibility Assessment**: Employees who receive variable remuneration are eligible to participate
2. **Allocation Decision**: During compensation review periods, eligible employees can elect to receive a portion of their variable compensation as warrants
3. **Issuance Process**: DTSC purchases warrants through BNP Paribas and allocates them to participating employees
4. **Holding Period**: Employees typically hold warrants for a specified period, during which market fluctuations affect their value
5. **Exercise or Sale**: Depending on market conditions, employees can exercise the warrants or sell them before expiration

## Important Considerations
* **Market Risk**: The value of warrants can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions
* **No Guarantees**: There is no guarantee that warrants will result in financial gain
* **Expiration**: Warrants have a defined expiration date, after which unexercised warrants may lose all value
* **Tax Implications**: While typically favorable, tax treatment can vary based on individual circumstances and regulatory changes
* **Liquidity**: Warrants may have limited liquidity compared to cash compensation

## Educational Resources
To help you understand this compensation option fully, we've prepared the following resources:

* **Detailed Explanation Video**: ""DTSC - explications Warrant-20230621_130246-Enregistrement de la r√©union.mp4"" - This comprehensive presentation explains the mechanics, benefits, and considerations of the warrant program

* **One-on-One Consultations**: Available upon request with our financial advisors
* **Written Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the BNP PARIBAS EASY EURO STOXX 50 UCITS ETF Warrant Call structure

## Making an Informed Decision
Before electing to receive warrants as part of your compensation:
* Watch the explanatory video completely
* Consider consulting with a personal financial advisor
* Assess your personal financial goals and risk tolerance
* Review historical performance of the Euro Stoxx 50 index
* Consider your expected employment duration at DTSC
