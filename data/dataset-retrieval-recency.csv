This innovative offering is designed with one key principle in mind: putting you in the driver's seat when it comes to your compensation package. We believe that your benefits should be as unique as you are, and the Cafeteria Plan is here to make that a reality.

What is the Cafeteria Plan?
Simply put, the Cafeteria Plan is a way for you to tailor your employee benefits to suit your individual needs and preferences. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, this plan allows you to choose from a menu of benefits that resonate with you. Whether you value extra time off, enhanced healthcare options, or other perks, this plan gives you the flexibility to create a benefits package that aligns perfectly with your life.

How and When?
Around November 25th each year, you will receive a document with a list of options to choose from and you will have approximately three weeks to complete and submit it.

Why is it Great for You?
Empowerment: We believe you should have a say in your benefits, and the Cafeteria Plan puts the power of choice back into your hands. It's all about empowering you to make decisions that matter most to you.
Customization: Your needs are unique, and so should be your benefits package. With the Cafeteria Plan, you can customize your compensation in a way that suits your life circumstances.
Satisfaction: When you have a benefits package that caters to your needs, it naturally leads to higher job satisfaction. We want you to be happy, engaged, and motivated in your role.
Work-Life Balance: Achieving a healthy work-life balance is essential. The Cafeteria Plan allows you to convert part of your salary into additional time off or other benefits that promote your well-being.
Financial Benefits: You can also choose benefits that make sense for your financial goals. From tax-advantaged options to retirement contributions, this plan helps you plan for your financial future.
Retention and Attraction: Not only does this plan benefit you, but it also makes us a more attractive employer. It can enhance our ability to attract top talent and keep our existing team members engaged and loyal.

What Benefits Can You Choose From?
Within the Cafeteria Plan, you have an array of benefits to choose from. These include:
1. Epargne-Pension (Pension Savings): Secure your financial future with tax-advantaged pension savings.
2. IT Devices and Internet Expenses: Cover your IT devices and internet costs.
3. Assurance Hospitalisation (Hospitalization Insurance): Enjoy hospitalization insurance with no impact on your employer's budget.
4. Check-Up M√©dical (Medical Check-Up): Prioritize your health with regular medical check-ups.
5. V√©lo (Bicycle): Get a tax deduction for your company bicycle (Avantage de Toute Nature or ATN).
6. Jours de Cong√©s Suppl√©mentaires (Extra Days Off): Enhance your work-life balance with extra vacation days.
7. Formations Professionnelles (Professional Training): Invest in your personal and professional growth with additional training.
8. Abonnement Salle de Sport (Gym Membership): Stay fit and active with a gym membership.
9. Mobilier de Bureau (Home Office Furniture): Create a comfortable home office space.
10. Montre Connect√©e (Smartwatch): Stay connected and organized with a smartwatch.
11. Option Cash en Prime (Cash Bonus): Choose a cash bonus for immediate financial flexibility.

These benefits are adaptable to your individual needs and preferences, giving you the power to create a benefits package that aligns perfectly with your life and goals.

This innovative offering is designed with one key principle in mind: putting you in the driver's seat when it comes to your compensation package. We believe that your benefits should be as unique as you are, and the Cafeteria Plan is here to make that a reality.

What is the Cafeteria Plan?
Simply put, the Cafeteria Plan is a way for you to tailor your employee benefits to suit your individual needs and preferences. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, this plan allows you to choose from a menu of benefits that resonate with you. Whether you value extra time off, enhanced healthcare options, or other perks, this plan gives you the flexibility to create a benefits package that aligns perfectly with your life.

How and When?
Around November 25th each year, you will receive a document with a list of options to choose from and you will have approximately three weeks to complete and submit it.

Why is it Great for You?
Empowerment: We believe you should have a say in your benefits, and the Cafeteria Plan puts the power of choice back into your hands. It's all about empowering you to make decisions that matter most to you.
Customization: Your needs are unique, and so should be your benefits package. With the Cafeteria Plan, you can customize your compensation in a way that suits your life circumstances.
Satisfaction: When you have a benefits package that caters to your needs, it naturally leads to higher job satisfaction. We want you to be happy, engaged, and motivated in your role.
Work-Life Balance: Achieving a healthy work-life balance is essential. The Cafeteria Plan allows you to convert part of your salary into additional time off or other benefits that promote your well-being.
Financial Benefits: You can also choose benefits that make sense for your financial goals. From tax-advantaged options to retirement contributions, this plan helps you plan for your financial future.
Retention and Attraction: Not only does this plan benefit you, but it also makes us a more attractive employer. It can enhance our ability to attract top talent and keep our existing team members engaged and loyal.

What Benefits Can You Choose From?
Within the Cafeteria Plan, you have an array of benefits to choose from. These include:
1. Epargne-Pension (Pension Savings): Secure your financial future with tax-advantaged pension savings.
2. IT Devices and Internet Expenses: Cover your IT devices and internet costs.
3. Assurance Hospitalisation (Hospitalization Insurance): Enjoy hospitalization insurance with no impact on your employer's budget.
4. Check-Up M√©dical (Medical Check-Up): Prioritize your health with regular medical check-ups.
5. V√©lo (Bicycle): Get a tax deduction for your company bicycle (Avantage de Toute Nature or ATN).
6. Jours de Cong√©s Suppl√©mentaires (Extra Days Off): Enhance your work-life balance with extra vacation days.
7. Formations Professionnelles (Professional Training): Invest in your personal and professional growth with additional training.
8. Abonnement Salle de Sport (Gym Membership): Stay fit and active with a gym membership.
9. Mobilier de Bureau (Home Office Furniture): Create a comfortable home office space.
10. Montre Connect√©e (Smartwatch): Stay connected and organized with a smartwatch.

Ci-dessous les principales conclusions du projet BB de David concernant la communication LinkedIn de la page DTSC.

Il y a 2 grands principes √† suivre pour que notre taux d'engament (c'est-√†-dire, en r√©sum√©, le taux mesurant les interactions de nos abonn√©s √† nos contenus) soit aux alentours de 10%:

- Il faut publier 1 √† 2 fois maximum par semaine;
- toujours s'assurer que nous r√©agissions aux posts, et les repartagions

Pour le reste, niveau contenu: il faut varier, pas de contenu ayant une pr√©dominance.

Charte graphique

Depuis le projet BB, une ligne graphique a √©t√© mise an place, pour que nos posts refl√®tent l'identit√© de DTSC.

Pour ce faire, les visuels ont √©t√© rassembl√©s dans l'outil figma:

- Figma
- Login
  - dbudin@dtsc.be
  - havZas-zywruq-4wemfe

Il y a diff√©rente sections:

- Celle a utiliser maintenant est: communication g√©n√©rale;
- Moodboard: c'est un palette graphique qui a permis de d√©finir l'esprit visuel de la page DTSC et les posts;
- LinkedIn: projet BB: rassemble l'ensemble des posts qui ont √©t√© cr√©√©s lors du projet BB de David;
- Pastille: plus d'application, regroupe nos anciens avatars Linkedin;",

To do so, here below are the steps to follow.

Connecting to the site
Go to the following URL : https://customer.connecting-expertise.com/.
Connect with the following credentials, if it is your first time:
Login : info@dtsc.be
Mot de passe : pipeline2029@DTSC
Or with your own credentials, if you have already created and use a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile.
After that, you will be redirected to the main page, where you can then access (A) the parameters setting panel, (B) the requests/vacature propositions panel, (C) or the customers/contract panel.

Creating a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile:
To create a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile, you need to go to the ‚Äúparameters setting panel‚Äù, click on ‚ÄúAdministration‚Äù and access the ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù tab. There click on ‚ÄúCreate a new user‚Äù and fill the corresponding information. It is not mandatory to create a ‚ÄúSales Manager‚Äù profile, everything can be done with the admin user ‚Äúinfo@dtsc.be‚Äù (Thibault Draye), though creating your own profile allows you to get mail notifications. The notifications setting can be changed through the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù tab of the ‚Äúparameters setting panel‚Äù.

Selecting activities of interest:
In the ‚ÄúMy Activities‚Äù tab of the ‚Äúparameters setting panel‚Äù, you can select sectors from which you want to see the potential vacatures and from which regions. Most of the relevant sectors in Belgium for DTSC have already been selected, but feel free to add new ones.

Finding a mission:
To find a vacature, you need to go to ‚Äúrequests received‚Äù tab in the ""requests panel"". There you will find all vacature propositions (accordingly to the activities settings) on which you can then apply specific filters. One interesting filter is the ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù filter that allows you to see past requests (if you want to have an idea about what kind of jobs a specific client is proposing).
Subsequently, when you have found a vacature that interests you, you can click on the reference hyperlink to propose your candidature. There you will be redirected to the ""request details"" page, where you have more details about the mission (e.g. description, desired start date, maximal daily rate, etc.). Then to candidate yourself or anyone else, you need to click on ‚ÄúCreate a proposal‚Äù and follow the filling steps. Though, pay attention to the ‚ÄúStatute‚Äù parameters in the ‚ÄúCreate a proposal‚Äù sub-window, as we all are DTSC employee, you need to select the latter option, if you are candidating yourself or anyone of us.

Afterwards, when your proposal has been created, you need to publish it to make it effective.

Following a candidature:
When the proposal is published, it is then sent to the client and you can find it back in the ‚ÄúOngoing proposals‚Äù tab of the ‚Äúrequests panel‚Äù.",How do I log in to Connecting Expertise?

Legal Leave Days

Legal leave days must be taken during the corresponding calendar year, in accordance with Article 64 of the Royal Decree of March 30, 1967. Postponing these days to the following year is not allowed. Even substituting payment for actual leave is not permitted, except in cases of extended incapacity for work.

It is worth noting that while certain companies may tolerate the carryover of legal leave days to the following year, this practice contradicts the law. Any exception to this rule must be justified by exceptional circumstances and documented in case of a specific request by an employee.

RTT / Compensatory Rest Days

It is imperative to take the reduction of working time (RTT) / compensatory rest days before the end of the year to avoid exceeding the average working duration (38 hours per week).

In conclusion, at DTSC, we adhere to the rules and laws regarding the deferral of leave days currently in force.

We have extracted relevant information from a regulation to provide you with a clear and precise overview of these rules.

Legal Leave Days

Legal leave days must be taken during the corresponding calendar year, in accordance with Article 64 of the Royal Decree of March 30, 1967. Postponing these days to the following year is not allowed. Even substituting payment for actual leave is not permitted, except in cases of extended incapacity for work.

It is worth noting that while certain companies may tolerate the carryover of legal leave days to the following year, this practice contradicts the law. Any exception to this rule must be justified by exceptional circumstances and documented in case of a specific request by an employee.

RTT / Compensatory Rest Days

It is imperative to take the reduction of working time (RTT) / compensatory rest days before the end of the year to avoid exceeding the average working duration (38 hours per week).

In conclusion, at DTSC, we adhere to the rules and laws regarding the deferral of leave days currently in force. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these provisions to ensure optimal management of your leaves and to maintain a healthy balance between your professional and personal life.",

For the installation of the project, follow the instructions found on GitHub. Once the installation is complete, the next step is to fill out the .env file with the following configurations and the corresponding Odoo credentials (username & password). The user can check if the configurations are properly set with the code shown below. This script verifies the connection by printing the credentials and imports the necessary functions for exporting and importing the CRM leads. 2. Exporting leads to a CSV file. There are a few steps to follow to retrieve and save the leads from Odoo. Step 1: Choose the information (fields) to extract from Odoo CRM. Step 2: Choose the page (CRM in our case). Contacts page: 'res.partner'. CRM page: 'crm.lead'. Step 3: Choose a name for the file. Example: 'opportunities.csv'. The following image shows the structure of the code and the output with the CRM leads. 3. Importing leads from a CSV file. To import data, the user only needs to write the path location of the corresponding CSV file with the leads to import. The fields (columns) are already set up within the function; however, additional fields can be added. A complete list of the fields available can be accessed through the ""fields_available"" variable.",

Ce site permet de cibler une r√©gion du monde, et une langue, et d'analyser le nombre de requ√™tes par mois pour une chaine de mots.

Dans l'image ci dessous, j'ai fait la recherche en belgique neerlandophone, et je souhaite savoir si les gens cherchent plus le mot ""IA"" ou les mots ""Intelligences Artificielles"", on peut constater que le mot IA est recherch√© 10x plus, et doit donc √™tre pr√©sent √† de nombreuses reprises sur le site.

L'outil permet √©galement d'avoir des suggestions d'autres mots cl√©s en fonction du contexte, voir de connaitre le prix de google pour faire en sorte que nous soyons effectivement remont√© via des ads (pages sponsoris√©es).

Il est indispensable d'analyser les mots cl√©s avant de publier la page internet.

/!\ cela n'affecte que les recherches google, √©tant donn√© que les recherches par IA sont en langue naturelle, les chaines de charact√®res sont beaucoup plus longues /!

Analyse de la concurrence

Il est possible de rajouter des sites, ou une page pr√©cise d'un concurrent et d'analyser les mots cl√©s, par exemple si nous recherchons deux de nos concurrents et nos amis de TLSSC :

Pyxis : Axe ses mots sur les formations

Wemanity : Axe ses mots sur la gestion du changement

TLSSC : Axe ses mots sur la green belt

On voit directement que la strat√©gie de Wemanity est la bonne, les mots cl√©s les plus pr√©sents sur leurs sites ont une concurrence FAIBLE, il y a donc √©norm√©ment de chance qu'ils sortent du lot, la o√π 4 des 5 mots cl√©s principaux de Pyxis et de TLSSC ont une concurrence forte.""",

1-on-1
These quarterly meetings (every three months) with the CEO are an integral part of our company's commitment to employee development and engagement. By providing each individual with dedicated one-on-one time with our CEO, we ensure that everyone has a chance to voice their concerns, ask questions, and offer feedback on their experiences within the organization.

During these meetings, employees are encouraged to share their career aspirations and goals, and the CEO provides guidance and support on how to achieve them. This personalized attention not only helps individuals grow and succeed in their roles, but it also contributes to the overall success of the company by building a team of highly motivated and engaged employees.

In addition to discussing personal goals and aspirations, these meetings are also an opportunity to discuss the company's long-term strategy and vision. By keeping employees informed and engaged in the company's plans for growth and development, we ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and contributing to the overall success of the organization.

Overall, these individual meetings with the CEO serve as a critical touchpoint for our employees, helping to foster a culture of openness, transparency, and accountability. By regularly engaging with our team members in this way, we are able to build stronger relationships and create a more cohesive and effective team.

DTheme Sharing Companions
At DTheme Sharing Companions (DTSC), we recognize the paramount importance of communication and collaboration. These core values are the foundation of our organizational structure, which is designed to foster an environment where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.

DTSC organizes itself around specific themes, each of which members can freely join based on their interests and expertise. This thematic approach ensures that every member finds a space where they can connect, collaborate, and grow alongside like-minded peers.

Each theme is led by a dedicated coordinator whose responsibilities are crucial to the success and cohesion of the group. The coordinator's duties include:
Ensuring Effective Communication and Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating open communication within the theme and organizing relevant training sessions.
Monitoring Motivation and Addressing Issues: Keeping a pulse on member motivation and addressing any concerns promptly.
Fostering Business Opportunities: Developing business opportunities and missions for theme members.
Active Recruitment and Initial Screening: Seeking out new talent and conducting initial interviews.
Cross-Theme Collaboration: Representing their theme's interests and fostering collaboration with other themes.

DTransversal Service & Coordination
At DTSC, we believe that effective communication and collaboration are the keys to success. That's why every two weeks, we hold a virtual team meeting where all coordinators of the themes are invited to discuss the latest updates and exchange ideas on a variety of topics.

The DTransversal Service & Coordination (DTSC) structure is designed to bring together the coordinators of various themes to achieve the following objectives:
Ensure Cross-Theme Communication and Collaboration: DTSC promotes seamless communication and collaboration among the different themes, ensuring that all teams are aligned and working harmoniously towards common goals.
Share Best Practices: Coordinators share successful strategies and best practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning across all themes.
Review Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Regular review of KPIs ensures that the progress and performance of each theme are monitored, and necessary adjustments are made to achieve optimal outcomes.
Organize CoWorking & TeamBuilding Events: DTSC coordinates upcoming CoWorking and TeamBuilding events to enhance team cohesion, foster a positive work environment, and strengthen relationships among members.

Through these efforts, the DTransversal Service & Coordination structure ensures that DTSC operates as a unified and efficient organization, maximizing the potential of every member and theme.

DTSCoworking
At DTSC, we believe that working together and fostering a sense of community among our team members is essential for our success. That's why every two months, we organize a collective coworking day where our team members come together to work, connect, and collaborate.

This coworking day is structured to allow for both individual and collective work. The first half of the day is dedicated to individual work, allowing team members to focus on their client work and other individual tasks. During this time, team members are able to work for their clients remotely at the coworking location.

In the second half of the day, we come together as a team to work on internal projects and initiatives. This time is dedicated to brainstorming, collaboration, and collective problem-solving, allowing us to tackle important issues facing our organization and to ensure that we are all aligned with our common goals and objectives. During our CoWorking sessions, activities will be organized into workshops led by different themes. Each participant is free to join the workshops that interest them. This approach allows for dynamic interaction, learning, and collaboration across various areas of expertise within DTSC.

To ensure that all team members are able to participate, we rotate the location of our coworking day among different coworking spaces in the area. This not only allows us to experience a variety of workspaces and environments but also helps to make the commute accessible and convenient for everyone.

We recognize that building a sense of community and connectedness among our team members is critical for our organization's long-term success. By providing regular opportunities for our team members to come together, collaborate, and work towards shared goals, we are able to foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and excellence. In this way, we are able to deliver the best possible results for our clients, stakeholders, and team members alike.

DTeam Spirit Challenge
At DTSC, we recognize the importance of cultivating strong bonds and relationships among our team members that extend beyond the workplace. To achieve this goal, we organize an external activity every three months, which provides an opportunity for the team to come together and socialize in a more relaxed and informal setting. We call this initiative the ""DTeam Spirit Challenge.""

The primary objective of the DTeam Spirit Challenge is to foster a spirit of camaraderie and collaboration among our team members while engaging in a fun and exciting activity. Each challenge is carefully curated to appeal to a wide range of interests and personalities, with the aim of ensuring that everyone can participate and enjoy the experience.

Over the time, we have organized several activities that have become staples of our DTeam Spirit Challenge, including a Christmas dinner with all of our team members and their families, participating in the Brussels 20km race either by running or as part of our cheering squad, a gastronomic team dinner to unwind and de-stress from our busy schedules, and even a thrilling virtual reality experience that allowed us to immerse ourselves in the world of zombies.

Our DTeam Spirit Challenge events serve as a valuable opportunity for our team members to get to know each other outside of the office, build deeper connections, and develop a stronger sense of community. We believe that investing in these relationships is essential for creating a positive and productive workplace culture, which ultimately translates into better results for our clients and stakeholders.

At DTSC, we are committed to fostering a supportive, collaborative, and fun work environment where all team members feel valued and appreciated. Our DTeam Spirit Challenge is just one of the many ways in which we strive to achieve this goal, and we look forward to continuing this tradition for years to come.",What activities are included in the DTeam Spirit Challenge

These quarterly meetings (every three months) with the CEO are an integral part of our company's commitment to employee development and engagement. By providing each individual with dedicated one-on-one time with our CEO, we ensure that everyone has a chance to voice their concerns, ask questions, and offer feedback on their experiences within the organization.

This personalized attention not only helps individuals grow and succeed in their roles, but it also contributes to the overall success of the company by building a team of highly motivated and engaged employees.

In addition to discussing personal goals and aspirations, these meetings are also an opportunity to discuss the company's long-term strategy and vision. By keeping employees informed and engaged in the company's plans for growth and development, we ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and contributing to the overall success of the organization.

Overall, these individual meetings with the CEO serve as a critical touchpoint for our employees, helping to foster a culture of openness, transparency, and accountability. By regularly engaging with our team members in this way, we are able to build stronger relationships and create a more cohesive and effective team.

DTheme Sharing Companions
At DTheme Sharing Companions (DTSC), we recognize the paramount importance of communication and collaboration. These core values are the foundation of our organizational structure, which is designed to foster an environment where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.

DTSC organizes itself around specific themes, each of which members can freely join based on their interests and expertise. This thematic approach ensures that every member finds a space where they can connect, collaborate, and grow alongside like-minded peers.

Each theme is led by a dedicated coordinator whose responsibilities are crucial to the success and cohesion of the group. The coordinator's duties include:
Ensuring Effective Communication and Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating open communication within the theme and organizing relevant training sessions.
Monitoring Motivation and Addressing Issues: Keeping a pulse on member motivation and addressing any concerns promptly.
Fostering Business Opportunities: Developing business opportunities and missions for theme members.
Active Recruitment and Initial Screening: Seeking out new talent and conducting initial interviews.
Cross-Theme Collaboration: Representing their theme's interests and fostering collaboration with other themes.

DTransversal Service & Coordination
At DTSC, we believe that effective communication and collaboration are the keys to success. That's why every two weeks, we hold a virtual team meeting where all coordinators of the themes are invited to discuss the latest updates and exchange ideas on a variety of topics.

The DTransversal Service & Coordination (DTSC) structure is designed to bring together the coordinators of various themes to achieve the following objectives:
Ensure Cross-Theme Communication and Collaboration: DTSC promotes seamless communication and collaboration among the different themes, ensuring that all teams are aligned and working harmoniously towards common goals.
Share Best Practices: Coordinators share successful strategies and best practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning across all themes.
Review Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Regular review of KPIs ensures that the progress and performance of each theme are monitored, and necessary adjustments are made to achieve optimal outcomes.
Organize CoWorking & TeamBuilding Events: DTSC coordinates upcoming CoWorking and TeamBuilding events to enhance team cohesion, foster a positive work environment, and strengthen relationships among members.

Through these efforts, the DTransversal Service & Coordination structure ensures that DTSC operates as a unified and efficient organization, maximizing the potential of every member and theme.

DTSCoworking
At DTSC, we believe that working together and fostering a sense of community among our team members is essential for our success. That's why every two months, we organize a collective coworking day where our team members come together to work, connect, and collaborate.

This coworking day is structured to allow for both individual and collective work. The first half of the day is dedicated to individual work, allowing team members to focus on their client work and other individual tasks. During this time, team members are able to work for their clients remotely at the coworking location.

In the second half of the day, we come together as a team to work on internal projects and initiatives. This time is dedicated to brainstorming, collaboration, and collective problem-solving, allowing us to tackle important issues facing our organization and to ensure that we are all aligned with our common goals and objectives. During our CoWorking sessions, activities will be organized into workshops led by different themes. Each participant is free to join the workshops that interest them. This approach allows for dynamic interaction, learning, and collaboration across various areas of expertise within DTSC.

To ensure that all team members are able to participate, we rotate the location of our coworking day among different coworking spaces in the area. This not only allows us to experience a variety of workspaces and environments but also helps to make the commute accessible and convenient for everyone.

We recognize that building a sense of community and connectedness among our team members is critical for our organization's long-term success. By providing regular opportunities for our team members to come together, collaborate, and work towards shared goals, we are able to foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and excellence. In this way, we are able to deliver the best possible results for our clients, stakeholders, and team members alike.

DTeam Spirit Challenge
At DTSC, we recognize the importance of cultivating strong bonds and relationships among our team members that extend beyond the workplace. To achieve this goal, we organize an external activity every three months, which provides an opportunity for the team to come together and socialize in a more relaxed and informal setting. We call this initiative the ""DTeam Spirit Challenge.""

The primary objective of the DTeam Spirit Challenge is to foster a spirit of camaraderie and collaboration among our team members while engaging in a fun and exciting activity. Each challenge is carefully curated to appeal to a wide range of interests and personalities, with the aim of ensuring that everyone can participate and enjoy the experience.

Over the time, we have organized several activities that have become staples of our DTeam Spirit Challenge, including a Christmas dinner with all of our team members and their families, participating in the Brussels 20km race either by running or as part of our cheering squad, a gastronomic team dinner to unwind and de-stress from our busy schedules, and even a thrilling virtual reality experience that allowed us to immerse ourselves in the world of zombies.

Our DTeam Spirit Challenge events serve as a valuable opportunity for our team members to get to know each other outside of the office, build deeper connections, and develop a stronger sense of community. We believe that investing in these relationships is essential for creating a positive and productive workplace culture, which ultimately translates into better results for our clients and stakeholders.

At DTSC, we are committed to fostering a supportive, collaborative, and fun work environment where all team members feel valued and appreciated. Our DTeam Spirit Challenge is just one of the many ways in which we strive to achieve this goal, and we look forward to continuing this tradition for years to come.",

Executive summary

Opportunit√© : beaucoup de subsides existent en Belgique

Objectif :  avoir une connaissance minimum des subsides existants afin de faire appel aux subsides lorsque cela est possible pour un projet DTSC ou personnel (via DTSC).

Proc√©dure : Si vous pensez qu‚Äôun projet pourrait √™tre √©ligible, contactez Thibault.

A v√©rifier si toujours d'actualit√© lorsqu'on veut demander un subside :
Bernard Tilkens b.tilkens@next-steps.be (+ Florence Rubens en copie: f.rubens@next-steps.be)
Next Steps 

C‚Äôest un expert en financement et en subsides, il fait une veille permanente des diff√©rents subsides existants pour les PME en Belgique. Il travaille entre autres pour DTSC afin de voir pour quels subsides DTSC pourrait √™tre √©ligible.

What‚Äôs in for me ? Une partie du subside redistribu√© vers le consultant + r√©pond au besoin du consultant

Timing : plus nous avan√ßons rapidement, mieux c'est, car les d√©lais sont relativement longs. √Ä noter que les d√©penses ne peuvent √™tre rembours√©es par le subside qu'apr√®s r√©ception de l'accus√© de r√©ception (validation) du subside.

Obtenir des subsides peut √™tre un levier puissant pour le d√©veloppement des entreprises, mais les d√©marches et les crit√®res varient consid√©rablement selon les niveaux de gouvernance. En Belgique, les entreprises peuvent solliciter des subsides aupr√®s de diff√©rentes instances.

Chacune de ces entit√©s propose des aides sp√©cifiques, adapt√©es √† divers besoins et projets :

L‚ÄôUnion Europ√©enne : gr√¢le par rapport aux montants mais processus beaucoup plus complexes et contraignants (autant pour l‚Äôobtention que pour le suivi du subside). Subsides difficiles √† obtenir. (exemple : Fonds de transition √©nerg√©tique | SPF Economie)

F√©d√©ral : en charge des subsides en rapport avec les charges sociales, imp√¥ts, fiscalit√©, pr√©compte prof. & imp√¥t des soci√©t√©s.
R&D aussi bien en interne que pour compte de tiers
TAx Shelter (investissement entrant, croissance)
R√©duction de cotisations sociales (r√©duction pour les 6 premiers salari√©s)

R√©gions : Subsides √† vocation d√©veloppement √©conomique des entreprises :
Flandres : 30 √† 50 subsides
Bxl : 140
R√©gion Wallonne : 400 subsides

Une entreprise a un si√®ge social dans une r√©gion mais peut avoir plusieurs si√®ges d‚Äôexploitation et donc avoir acc√®s aux subsides de diff√©rentes r√©gions.
Attention : On ne va pas subsidier par les deux r√©gions la m√™me d√©pense, c‚Äôest ill√©gal (p√©nal) mais faire appel √† une r√©gion pour un projet n‚Äôexclut pas de faire appel √† une autre r√©gion.

5 familles de th√©matiques subsides r√©gionaux

Recherche & D√©veloppement
Un projet qui pr√©sente :

Des incertitudes √† caract√®re technologique, mais suffisamment convaincantes de par leur int√©r√™t industriel/commercial
Des incertitudes sur le planning (potentiellement plus long ou plus co√ªteux que pr√©vu), avec une dur√©e estim√©e d'environ deux ans.

Les subsides peuvent couvrir diff√©rents types de co√ªts :
Ressources humaines,
√âtudes de march√© (segments cibl√©s, pays vis√©s),
D√©p√¥t de brevet,
Prototypes,
Certifications CE.

Exemples d‚Äôapplication pour DTSC:

J‚Äôai une id√©e de nouveau projet √† d√©velopper, une plateforme innovante destin√©e √† am√©liorer la gestion des projets complexes. Ce projet pr√©sente des incertitudes technologiques importantes, notamment en ce qui concerne l'int√©gration de nouvelles fonctionnalit√©s bas√©es sur l'intelligence artificielle et l'analyse pr√©dictive. De plus, le planning du projet est incertain, avec une dur√©e estim√©e d'environ deux ans, mais potentiellement plus longue ou plus co√ªteuse que pr√©vu.

Je pourrais faire appel aux subsides pour engager un d√©veloppeur, r√©aliser des √©tudes de march√©, des prototypes, etc. Je fais appel √† Bernard.

Je travaille sur une mission/projet de recherche et d√©veloppement au sein d‚Äôune entreprise. Je pourrais faire subventionner mes heures de travail par DTSC, ou l‚Äôentreprise (utilisateur final ou ‚Äòimpl√©menteur‚Äô) pour l‚Äôensemble de l‚Äô√©quipe du projet d‚Äôimpl√©mentation. Tr√®s concr√®tement : Impl√©mentation d‚Äôun nouveau protocole de communication pour des armoires de protection avec 2 fournisseurs externes (General Electric et Siemens) et impl√©menter par un client (Elia) et avec un consultant chef de Projets DTSC : Elia peut faire appel √† des subsides pour financer l‚Äôensemble du projet d‚Äôimpl√©mentation. General Electric et Siemens peuvent √©galement faire subsidier leur charge de travail sur le projet. DTSC peut faire appel √† des subsides pour financer les heures du consultant chef de projet.

Engagements

Subsides √† l‚Äôembauche, pour des profils non technologiques
Entreprise de moins de 50ETP : demandeur d‚Äôemploi la veille de l‚Äôembauche ‚Äì subside qui peut durer jusque 3 ans, montant d√©gressif d‚Äôann√©e en ann√©e (36K‚Ç¨ premi√®re ann√©e) - Jusque 5 personnes en parall√®le- Montant forfaitaire √† l‚Äôentreprise pay√© trimestriellement. Si la personne part ‚Äì obligation de r√©engager dans les 6 mois

Recrutement de jeunes dipl√¥m√©s : Subsidier l'embauche de jeunes dipl√¥m√©s pour leur offrir une premi√®re exp√©rience professionnelle.
Formation continue des employ√©s : Financer des programmes de formation pour am√©liorer les comp√©tences des employ√©s actuels
Stages et apprentissages : Couvrir les co√ªts li√©s √† l'accueil de stagiaires ou d'apprentis dans l'entreprise.
Int√©gration de travailleurs handicap√©s : Subsidier l'embauche et l'adaptation des postes de travail pour les personnes en situation de handicap.

Dans le cadre de mon projet Black Belt, je souhaite solliciter un subside pour l'engagement d'une personne. Ce projet, qui vise √† optimiser nos processus internes et √† am√©liorer notre efficacit√© op√©rationnelle, n√©cessite une assistance administrative pour assurer son bon d√©roulement. L'engagement d'un assistant administratif permettra de lib√©rer du temps pour me concentrer sur les aspects strat√©giques et analytiques du projet. Je fais appel √† Bernard pour savoir si ce projet est √©ligible √† un subside.

Consultance

Pour entreprise de moins de 250 ETP : plut√¥t li√© √† la croissance, √©tudes de march√©, aspects RH
Ch√®que entreprise : possibilit√© de r√©cup√©rer 70% des co√ªts si l‚Äôentreprise est labellis√©e ch√®que entreprise (pour la Wallonie) (pour Bruxelles il existe le m√™me type de subside ; au moins 3 ans d‚Äôexp√©rience √† son CV , crit√®res officiels et officieux)
Ch√®ques langues : prendre des cours de Ndls (Subsidi√© √† 60%), ‚Ä¶
Ch√®ques formations : subsidier formation dans les 6 premiers mois de l‚Äôengagement

Dans le cadre de mon projet Black Belt, je sollicite un expert certifi√© ¬´ Cheque Entreprise ¬ª pour des comp√©tences sp√©cifiques.

Exportation

D√©placement physique : Participer √† des foires internationales, faire une √©tude de march√© internationale, ouvrir une succursale √† l‚Äô√©tranger, participer √† une mission commerciale, d√©velopper des partenariats internationaux, faire de la prospection, ‚Ä¶‚ÄØ (via l‚ÄôAWEX ou Bruxelles export)

Marketing orient√© √©tranger (doit √™tre minimum en Anglais)  
Je contacte Bernard pour savoir si ce projet pourrait √™tre √©ligible √† un subside, afin de couvrir mes frais de voyage, les entr√©es aux foires commerciales et mon h√©bergement √† New York.

Investissements

Achat mat√©riel, b√¢timent : intervention faible mais sur de plus gros montants mais aussi r√©novation/travaux

Executive summary

Opportunit√© : beaucoup de subsides existent en Belgique

Objectif :  avoir une connaissance minimum des subsides existants afin de faire appel aux subsides lorsque cela est possible pour un projet DTSC ou personnel (via DTSC).

Proc√©dure : Si vous pensez qu'un projet pourrait √™tre √©ligible, contactez Thibault.

A v√©rifier si toujours d'actualit√© lorsqu'on veut demander un subside :
Bernard Tilkens b.tilkens@next-steps.be (+ Florence Rubens en copie: f.rubens@next-steps.be)
Next Steps 

C'est un expert en financement et en subsides, il fait une veille permanente des diff√©rents subsides existants pour les PME en Belgique. Il travaille entre autres pour DTSC afin de voir pour quels subsides DTSC pourrait √™tre √©ligible.

What's in for me ? Une partie du subside redistribu√© vers le consultant + r√©pond au besoin du consultant

Timing : plus nous avan√ßons rapidement, mieux c'est, car les d√©lais sont relativement longs. √Ä noter que les d√©penses ne peuvent √™tre rembours√©es par le subside qu'apr√®s r√©ception de l'accus√© de r√©ception (validation) du subside.

Obtenir des subsides peut √™tre un levier puissant pour le d√©veloppement des entreprises, mais les d√©marches et les crit√®res varient consid√©rablement selon les niveaux de gouvernance. En Belgique, les entreprises peuvent solliciter des subsides aupr√®s de diff√©rentes instances.

Chacune de ces entit√©s propose des aides sp√©cifiques, adapt√©es √† divers besoins et projets :

L'Union Europ√©enne : gr√¢le par rapport aux montants mais processus beaucoup plus complexes et contraignants (autant pour l'obtention que pour le suivi du subside). Subsides difficiles √† obtenir. (exemple : Fonds de transition √©nerg√©tique | SPF Economie)

F√©d√©ral : en charge des subsides en rapport avec les charges sociales, imp√¥ts, fiscalit√©, pr√©compte prof. & imp√¥t des soci√©t√©s.
R&D aussi bien en interne que pour compte de tiers
TAx Shelter (investissement entrant, croissance)
R√©duction de cotisations sociales (r√©duction pour les 6 premiers salari√©s)

R√©gions : Subsides √† vocation d√©veloppement √©conomique des entreprises :
Flandres : 30 √† 50 subsides
Bxl : 140
R√©gion Wallonne : 400 subsides

Une entreprise a un si√®ge social dans une r√©gion mais peut avoir plusieurs si√®ges d'exploitation et donc avoir acc√®s aux subsides de diff√©rentes r√©gions.
Attention : On ne va pas subsidier par les deux r√©gions la m√™me d√©pense, c'est ill√©gal (p√©nal) mais faire appel √† une r√©gion pour un projet n'exclut pas de faire appel √† une autre r√©gion.

Lean (productivity) Six Sigma (variability) is a management method made to improve the quality and the efficiency of the processes.
This continuous improvement approach offers many advantages:
it improves the client's satisfaction;
it increases the global performance of the enterprise;
it responds to the strategic objectives.
Being Lean is to operate in an economical way, without wasting resources and time. Simply produce what's needed to meet the demand. It also means promote the agility of the operations and the ability to quickly deliver the customers.
Being Six Sigma means delivering products to the customers that meet their expectations. Hence, a process operating at Six Sigma quality level will generate only three defects per million occurrences. This level of quality indicates the direction to follow.
Because it is based on the experience of the people in the field, it allows us to involve and motivate the employees at all levels of the company to satisfy the customer.

Scrum
In software development, Agile is not only an iterative and incremental approach but rather a ""mindset"" to be able to face and respond to change.
Agile software development gathers all practices and frameworks based on the Agile manifesto.
Scrum is one of the most widely used Agile frameworks, it is a lightweight framework based on empiricism and Lean thinking (as explained in the Scrum guide), to address complex problems and deliver value as soon as possible to the customers.
This is done by autonomous teams working using short cycles called ""sprints"" and the introduction of roles, ceremonies, artifacts described in the Scrum guide.
Nowadays, many organizations give training about Scrum and the best way to find the training session that suits you is to go to Scrum.org or Scrum Alliance.org. There you will have access to the schedule of all the classes given by coaches all around the world. At DTSC we have no preference but we have a good experience with PYXIS. Feel free to propose a training session to your CEO for approval.
